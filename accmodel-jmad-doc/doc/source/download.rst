Webstart
--------

The easieast way to try the JMad GUI is to use the java webstart by pointing your Browser to
<http://www.cern.ch/jmad/static/ws/accmodel-jmad-gui.jnlp>.

Binary distribution:
--------------------

If you want to have the JMad GUI running locally on your computer, then you can download and unzip the 
following *two* zip files from the JMad web-site:

* http://jmad.web.cern.ch/jmad/static/download/accmodel-jmad-gui-dist.zip
* and  http://jmad.web.cern.ch/jmad/static/download/accmodel-jmad-gui-support.zip

*NOTE:* You have to unzip both zip files into the same root folder! 

The unzipped folder `accmodel-jmad-gui` then contains startup scripts for windows and linux. We recommend to add
this directory to your system path. This way the installation can also easily be used by PyMad, http://www.cern.ch/pymad.
